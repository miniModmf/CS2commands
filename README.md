# CS2commands

This is a Vite + React source project for **CS2 Console Commands** (multi-page, pagination).
It is a source scaffold — **you must run the build locally**.

## How to build & deploy

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Preview build:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

- Option A: Upload the contents of `dist/` to your `gh-pages` branch or to the `docs/` folder on `main`.
- Option B: Use GitHub Actions to build and deploy automatically.

Note: `vite.config.js` sets `base: '/CS2commands/'`. If you plan to deploy to a different path, change that value.
